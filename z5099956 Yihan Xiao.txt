--------------------------------------------------------------
Week2:
 
- Group formed
- Basic study of DApp and syntax of Solidity
- Go through practice of MetaMask
--------------------------------------------------------------
Week3: 

- Begin to cooperate in Trello
- In charge of Epic section of project proposal
- Continue to study use of Solidity and Web3.js

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week4ï¼š
- Finish fundamental study of smart contract
- Try to deploy smart contract with Ganache
- Successfully implement basic feature of smart contract based on simple variables
- Build Web project with Express(Node.js)
- Tried alternative way to build Web project with Python(Flask) which I've been familiarized with, give up   
  eventually since web3.py is not well supported and maintained as web3.js. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week5:
- Update the basic smart contract project with new features
- Learned how to use event in Solidity, which can go along with JS to obtain data from contract instantly.
- Build a simple demo page for simulating purchasing event and showing the hash record of each purchase on web page.
- Web project is now working with Ganache and Remix independently, which need to be integrated in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week6:
- Prepare for Mide-term Demo in this week.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week7:
- Go through integrated process of Truffle.
- The Solidity code can be combined within Project now, rather then work in Remix independently.
- Resign smart contract
- Implementing the trade page from which the transaction hash will be read automatically after each trade.
- Refine the structure of Web3 calling, packing into a seperate file which is relatively easy and clean to use
- Conquer the concurrent strategy of Javascript, learnt the async/await method and Promise, which helps to solve
  the call-back problem from Blockchain.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week8:
- Adding balance checking function, now users can refresh their balance instantly on the profile page.
- Implementing a loading page with JS, which is useful when the trade needs time to deploy on Blockchain.
- Refine the mongoDB database design.
- Fix several bugs of web pages, including the erroreous price calculation.
- Refine the structure of smart contract, trying to implement escrow payment function.
- Connected with the purchase/sale history page, now the block address can be displayed automatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week9:
- Escrow function done. Now the smart contract is able to hold the deposit from buyer and wait for the buyer
  to confirm.
- Seller can received the money released from smart contract automatically.
- Adding flag event on user page to inform the change of status of each trade.
- Fix bugs of frond-end web pages

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week10:
- Adding delivery function to seller. Now seller can choose to make delivery and system will record the delivery
  information to inform buyer.
- Adding safety functions include safeMath to Solidity code. The balance now would be double checked when 
  user try to purchase.
- Adding online rate check, the price shown on every single item page will be transferred into AUD and shown 
  in a small notice toolkit for user.
- Redesign the main Logo and icon of currency(ethereum)

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week11:
- Fix several bugs of database functions.
- Fix the size problem of image displayed.
- Refine the functions of checkout module, discarding all trivial files.
- Refine the management of addresses, user will be assigned an address automatically from address-pool.
- Refine the process of trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Week12:
- Keep debugging and prepare for final Demo
- Write final report of project. In charge of block-chain function and implementation challange and initialization/guide parts
- Write Readme file
